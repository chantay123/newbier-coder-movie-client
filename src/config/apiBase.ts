/**
 * apiBase.ts
 *
 * The single source of truth for resolving the REST API base URL, the origin
 * used for static assets, and the WebSocket URL.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * Before, every service read the environment variables in its own way:
 *   - `axiosConfig.ts` preferred `NEXT_PUBLIC_CORE_API_URL`
 *   - `config/API.ts`, `adService`, `statsService`, `watchlistService` and
 *     others only read `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
 *   - some places fell back to `http://localhost:5000/api` (missing `/v1`)
 *   - `MovieRating`, `admin/premium` and `WebSocketContext` hardcoded localhost
 * The result: one app, but requests went to three different base URLs
 * depending on the file.
 *
 * THE BASE URL CONTRACT
 * The production backend only serves routes under `/api/v1`. This was verified
 * directly: `/api/movies` returns `404 Route not found`, while
 * `/api/v1/movies` returns `401 Missing Bearer token`. That is why every
 * relative endpoint in the source code (`/movies`, `/auth/login`, ...) is joined
 * with a base that ends in `/api/v1`.
 *
 * WHY THE BROWSER NEVER SEES THE BACKEND HOST
 * Every `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variable is inlined into the client bundle at build
 * time, so a public backend URL would be readable by anyone who opens
 * DevTools. To keep the backend host private, the URL is read from a
 * SERVER-ONLY variable (`BACKEND_API_URL`, no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix), which
 * Next.js replaces with `undefined` in the browser bundle.
 *
 * The browser therefore talks to the SAME ORIGIN through two proxy prefixes,
 * which `next.config.ts` rewrites to the real backend:
 *   - `/api/backend` -> the API base (ends with `/api/v1`)
 *   - `/api/media`  -> the backend ORIGIN (for `/uploads/...` assets, which
 *                      live at the root of the backend, NOT under `/api/v1`)
 *
 * The result:
 *   - the client bundle contains no host, no port and no scheme;
 *   - the browser never makes a cross-origin request to the backend;
 *   - the server keeps calling the backend directly (no extra hop).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this file must NEVER reference a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variable that
 * holds the backend URL. Doing so would inline it into the client bundle and
 * defeat the whole mechanism.
