/**
 * @file notificationService.ts
 * @description Admin notification feed: list, mark read, delete.
 *
 * NOTE: The current backend does not expose `GET /admin/notifications`
 * (responds 404 — confirmed in the dev server log). Until the backend
 * ships this endpoint, `getNotifications()` swallows the 404 and returns
 * an empty list so the AdminHeader bell does not crash. Any other error
 * (401, 500, network) is re-thrown so we can debug it. This is *not* a
 * fake success: when the endpoint is live, the response is returned
 * unchanged. The bell will simply show "0" until the backend catches up.
