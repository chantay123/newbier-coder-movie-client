 * Normalizes the `episodes` array from the backend into snake_case.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 * The movie-detail API returns episode servers in **camelCase**:
 * ```json
 * [{ "serverName": "Vietsub #1", "serverData": [
 *     { "id": "...", "name": "1", "slug": "tap-1",
 *       "linkEmbed": "https://embed13.streamc.xyz/embed.php?hash=...",
 *       "linkM3u8": "" }] }]
 * ```
 * but every consumer in the app (`EpisodeDirectory`, `MovieHeroHeader`,
 * `WatchSidebarPlaylist`, `MoviePlayerSection`, `watch.tsx`) reads the
 * **snake_case** contract — `server_name` / `server_data` / `link_embed` /
 * `link_m3u8`.
 *
 * Because those interfaces all carry `[key: string]: unknown`, TypeScript
 * could not catch the mismatch, so at runtime `server.server_data` was
 * `undefined`. The symptoms were: the episode directory rendered nothing,
 * the server tab showed a fallback name, and the player showed the message
 * "the episode stream is being updated" even though the movie had 12
 * playable episodes.
 *
 * ## Why we add aliases instead of renaming
 * The camelCase keys are kept alongside the snake_case ones so that admin
 * screens (which save `server_name`/`server_data`) and any legacy caller
 * reading the raw payload keep working. Only additive changes are made.
